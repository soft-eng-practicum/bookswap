* IP Percent Rights: Spoke with Hailey, our client, on the percent rights. We had agreed to 30% - Hailey & 10% everyone else. Xavier has agreed to this update. Adam is nonresponsive. Winston has disagreed and holds the desire for a 15% interest. Possible: knock IP rights holders out to increase %s in who whats rights. We may go with knocking out Adam, since he's not responded, and see if Sierra or Waylon want an interest...
